    Security of your information is a priority at Devtor and we take a range of measures to help protect it, including encryption of sensitive information.

    <h2><span style=" color: #C71585;"><a name="section5"></a>5. Children</span></h2>
    We are all aware of the bad impacts when something goes wrong and affects children.<br /><br />
    In the very first game Feed your Pig, we set the admited age at 4+ to make sure that this game could not be played by children who are below that standard. It also a sign for parents to recognize and give their children the admission to play (or not).<br /><br />
    In the upcoming games, we will absolutely require players to show their age before joining if those games have contents and images that are applicable for higher ages.
